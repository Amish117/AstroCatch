Why have i chosen to code AstroCatch, the idea came from one night where i was watching the movie pixles, and thinking about the 80s, and 90s, thinking about the video games would play then, I had a chat to my dad and he was telling me the stories he had back in his days where him and his freinds would play on the arcade machines, space invaders is what cvaught my attention and i knew then i should create a arcade style game. The idea of space came from the similar theme, retro arcade games would look like they are from space
